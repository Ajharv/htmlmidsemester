<aside>The Filipino Martial Arts (FMA) cover a variety of martial arts that were developed by tribes in the Philippines.
The current most popular branches of FMA are Escrima, Arnis, and Kali.  Kali is the term popularized by Dan Inosanto.
All of these systems are known to cover a wide variety of combative situations including techniques for grappling, punching, kicking, throwing,
and most famously, weapons.  There are a variety of weapons in FMA, but the knife and stick (or baton) are among the most popular. 
Knives are common weapons even in modern times, the simple stick is something that can easily be found in almost any environment and techniques learned with the stick
can be adapted for use with a short sword, something less common and easy to find in modern times.  Below is shown the first five strikes in 
the Inosanto/LaCoste system.
